# Basic Variant Calling & Visualization Course

Welcome to our one-hour bioinformatics workshop. In this workshop, we will cover:

1. **Basic Variant Calling Concepts and File Formats**  
2. **A Quick Demonstration of Using GATK for Variant Calling** (demonstration only)  
3. **Visualization Using IGV** (hands-on session)

This workshop is designed for undergraduate medical students to introduce some basic bioinformatics concepts, offer a guided demonstration of GATK, and provide hands-on experience with the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV).

## Workshop Agenda

- **Introduction (5 minutes)**
  - Overview of workshop topics and objectives.
  
- **Section 1: Basic Variant Calling Concepts and File Formats (20 minutes)**
  - Introduction to genetic variants.
  - Significance of genetic variants.
  - HTS worflow.
  - Overview of common file formats:
    - **FASTA/FASTQ** for raw sequences.
    - **SAM/BAM** for alignment data.
    - **VCF** for variant calls.

- **Section 2: GATK Demonstration (10 minutes)**
  - Brief introduction to GATK.
  - Walkthrough of a variant calling process:
    - Pre-processing and alignment.
    - Variant calling and filtering.
  - Explanation of key GATK commands (demonstration only â€“ no hands-on due to time constraint).

- **Section 3: Visualization Using IGV (20 minutes)**
  - Overview of IGV.
  - Hands-on session:
    - Load custom genomic FASTA, annotation (GFF)files
    - Load and explore the provided human VCF file (and optional BAM file).
    - Navigate the IGV interface, zoom, etc.
  - Discussion of how visualization aids in confirming variant calling results.

- **Wrap-Up and Q&A (5 minutes)**
  - Recap of key points.
  - Open session for questions and discussion.
